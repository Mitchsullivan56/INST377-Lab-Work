    <h2>First, the basics.</h2>

    <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
    <div class="class_two">
    <ul>
      <li>HTML and CSS</li>
      <li>Javascript</li>
      <li>Node.js</li>
      <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should list your top 3 goals for the class below.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Learn front-end web design</li>
      <li>Learn new programming languages</li>
      <li>Learn how to work with others in a technical space</li>
      <li>Learn popular web dev frameworks</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div class="class_three">
    <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

    <p>
      Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of
      text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the
      text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em>
    </p>
  </div>
    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.</p>
    <p>Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</p>
    <p>
      Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line
      breaks to match your page to the sample.
    </p>

    <h2>Images</h2>
    <div class="class_four">
    <p>
      Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for
      accessibility.
    </p>
    </div>
